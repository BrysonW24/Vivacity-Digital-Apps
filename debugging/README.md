## 🛠 Debugging & Troubleshooting Guide
### **1️⃣ Essential Debugging Tools**
- **Flutter DevTools** → Inspect UI performance, memory usage, and logs.
- **VS Code Debugger** → Set breakpoints, step through code, and watch variables.
- **Android Studio Debugger** → Analyze CPU, GPU, and memory performance.
- **Firebase Crashlytics** → Monitor real-time crash reports.
- **Sentry** → Track application errors across environments.

### **2️⃣ Common Debugging Scenarios**
| Issue | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| App crashes on startup | Check logs with `flutter run --verbose` |
| Slow UI performance | Use `flutter performance` in DevTools |
| Memory leaks | Track with `flutter pub run observatory` |
| API calls fail intermittently | Debug with `flutter logs` and retry logic |
| Inconsistent UI rendering | Inspect widget rebuilds using `debugPrint` |

### **3️⃣ Best Practices for Debugging**
- **Always log errors** using `debugPrint()` and structured logging.
- **Use breakpoints** to pause and analyze variables in real-time.
- **Monitor app performance** and avoid unnecessary rebuilds.
- **Leverage error tracking tools** like Firebase Crashlytics and Sentry.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- ✅ Add **logging & debugging tool configurations**
- ✅ Provide **guidelines for debugging network & API issues**
- 🔜 Implement **structured debugging workflow documentation**
- 🔜 Expand **performance optimization strategies**
