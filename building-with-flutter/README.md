## 🛠 Developer Guidelines
### **1️⃣ Setting Up Flutter for Development**
1. **Install Flutter & Dart** ([Official Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install))
2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrysonW24/Vivacity-Digital-Apps.git
   ```
3. **Navigate to the `building-with-flutter/` directory**
   ```bash
   cd building-with-flutter
   ```
4. **Run the Flutter Doctor Command**
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```
   ✅ Ensures all dependencies are installed correctly.

5. **Run an Example App**
   ```bash
   cd 3-apps/flutter-counter-app
   flutter run
   ```

### **2️⃣ Best Practices for Flutter Development**
- Follow **clean architecture principles**.
- Use **state management** appropriate for the project size.
- Implement **dependency injection** for scalable applications.
- Use **responsive UI techniques** for different screen sizes.
- Leverage **cloud integration** (Firebase, AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalable backend services.

### **3️⃣ Cloud & API Integrations**
- **Firebase** → Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Messaging
- **AWS Amplify** → Hosting, authentication, and GraphQL API
- **Google Cloud Firestore** → NoSQL database integration
- **Azure Blob Storage** → Cloud-based media storage

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- ✅ Document **Flutter architecture patterns**
- ✅ Include **starter apps & examples**
- 🔜 Add **Flutter CI/CD pipeline setup**
- 🔜 Expand **cloud integration guides** (AWS, Firebase, GCP, Azure)
- 🔜 Provide **Flutter best practices & performance optimizations**
