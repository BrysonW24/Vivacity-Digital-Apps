# DevOps - Vivacity Digital Apps

## 📌 Overview
The `devops/` directory is designed to **streamline deployment, automation, and infrastructure management** for Flutter applications within Vivacity Digital Apps. This section provides guidelines on CI/CD pipelines, cloud deployment strategies, infrastructure as code (IaC), and security best practices.

## 🛠 DevOps Guidelines
### **1️⃣ Setting Up CI/CD for Flutter**
- **GitHub Actions** → Automate Flutter builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Bitrise** → Mobile CI/CD tool with Flutter-specific workflows.
- **GitLab CI/CD** → Alternative CI/CD pipeline.

### **2️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Terraform** → Automate cloud infrastructure across AWS, GCP, Azure.
- **Ansible** → Configuration management for provisioning servers.

### **3️⃣ Deployment Strategies**
- **Firebase Hosting** → Deploy web apps efficiently.
- **AWS Amplify** → Scalable hosting & backend.
- **Google Cloud Run** → Serverless Flutter app hosting.
- **Azure Static Web Apps** → Cost-effective cloud hosting.

### **4️⃣ Observability & Monitoring**
- **Sentry** → Real-time error tracking & debugging.
- **Firebase Analytics** → App performance monitoring.
- **Grafana + Prometheus** → Cloud monitoring dashboards.

### **5️⃣ Security Best Practices**
- 🔐 **Use secret management tools** for API keys.
- 🛠 **Run automated dependency scans** to check for vulnerabilities.
- ✅ **Implement code signing** to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- ✅ Establish **CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployment
- ✅ Implement **IaC for cloud resource provisioning**
- 🔜 Improve **observability with full-stack monitoring tools**
- 🔜 Automate **security & compliance checks**
